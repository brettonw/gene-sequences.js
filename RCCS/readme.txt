Attached is the data from an analysis of HIV in Rakai Uganda.  Here there are more than 1000 subjects who contributed viral sequence data (the RCCS R13 gp41 text file).  For this file each row is a sequence of a different person.  Their ID is a letter followed by 6 numbers. The R13 is which visit (round 13), the next number is the geographic region in Rakai that they come form and the last letter is the subtype assignment of the virus. 

 

There is an excel file with a listing of all co habituating couples.  Column A and B are the two individuals.  The letter and the six digits that follows is the subject identifier.  The stuff that followes is their region, village and household designation and the two letters are subtype assignments for different parts of the virus.  Column C is about their infection status.  An ‘I’ means they were incident (infected this round). A P means they were prevalent (they were positive on a previous round).
