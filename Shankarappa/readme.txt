Attached are data sets of three different individuals from a very famous study on HIV sequence evolution.

It has been cited by close to 1000 other research papers on viral evolution particularly HIV

 

Each text file is sequence data from a different individual, where there are multiple sequences per subject time point. The naming system is the patient number, then c or p (cells/plasma), then the month of sampling, then the clone. So P7c80 1075 means patient 7 sequence from cells 80 months post seroconversion clone #1075.

There are multiple sequences per subject time point.  The quasispecies (cloud of related viruses inside a person gets more diverse with time.  Though very late in infection the most fit virus is thought to outgrow the rest of the viruses so you may get a decrease in viral diversity.
